# 3 Step Writing system: Blogging & Writing

## You have to have a System to Succeed!

The reason for people not reaching their goal lies in the fact that:

1. They know what their goal is.
2. But the system to reach the goal is not in place.

Develop the system and you can reach any goal you desire.

## 3-Step Writing System

### Step 1: Collection Ideas

Collect Ideas = Collect Inspiration

> If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot".
>> - Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the craft

> The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love."
>> - Austin Kleon, Steal like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told you About Being Creative.

#### Be selective about what you consume

1. Read what you need
2. Collect content from various sources, but personalize your feeds.
3. Collect with intent to personalize. (Great art inspires art)

#### Secret to Making your Writing Stand Out

__Unique writing is the result of combining inspiration with your personal perspective!__

The 3-Step Writing System Workflow looks like this:

| Step 1 -> | Step 2 -> | Step 3 -> |
|----------|:-------------:|----:|
| Collect  | Curate        | Publish |
| (Inspiration & Ideas) | (Organize Ideas) | (Publish Ideas) |
| - Books | | |
| - Online Articles | | |
| - Movies/TV | | |

Creating great articles:
Use the content you find in articles as inspiration for a framework of writing.
Add your personal experience & personality to the article

#### Secret to Personalizing Your Inspiration Feeds

My favorite "feed" apps and services:
- Pocket (articles)
- Feedly (articles)
- Blinkist (books)
- Netflix (documentaries)
- YouTube (miscellaneous - example "Writing Inspiration")


### Step 2: Curate

Meaning:
To pull through, sift through, and select for presentation.

Tips:
1. Curate selectively.
  - Dont select everything.
  - Select what is personal to __you__ and what you are __qualified__ to write about.
2. Think like a museum curator
  - They are specific about what they accept and only choose the top quality.
  - Think quality ideas and best ideas.
3. Only keep the ideas you are passionate about.
  - Write what you are inspired to write about.
  - Be passionate about the topic you are writing.
  - Execute the passionate topics so you connect emotionally.
4. Too many ideas
  - Store and organize them in a structure so you dont need to keep them in your head.
  - Keen one physical notebook and one digital notebook to store ideas.

#### The Secret to Building a Writers Notebook

Rule #1: Make sure its always within reach
  - So you dont loose your ideas.

Rule #2: Buy a quality notebook
  - Advantage: Psychological affect:
    - When you pay more it means more which makes you keep up with it better.  

Why a physical notebook:
  - Physical material is more "real" to the brain.
  - It has more meaning, and a place.
  - It is better connected to memory because it engages with its spatial memory networks.

Good notebooks:
- Leuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook - Dotted Pages - Black - $20
- Moleskine Classic Notebook, Large, Ruled, Black, Hard Cover

#### The Secret to Building a Digital Notebook
- Bear Writing - Mac digital notebook

## Step 3: Develop and Publish

### Building an Article Outline

- Pick a focus for the article

- Build a roadmap of the article defining the major points
  - This can be done by choosing headlines and integrating them in PS pics for the article
  - This is where i start -> This is where i end

#### The Anatomy of an Article

Every article looks something like this:

`ARTICLE TEMPLATE:`
```
HEADLINE

Anecdote or Nut Graph: (2-4 sentences)

Transition to body copy: (1-2 sentences)

  - Supportive point: (3-4 sentences)
  - Supportive point: (3-4 sentences)
  - Supportive point: (3-4 sentences)

Closing paragraph: (2-4 sentences)

Closing sentence: (1 Punchy, powerful sentence)
```

__Headline:__ The most important part of an article - Spend time to make sure the headline of your article reads

__Anecdote/NutGraph:__ Introduction to your article, anything from a paragraph to 2-4 sentences.

__Body Copy:__ Consists of a few supportive points  - Very important to stay focused on these points, make your points come across!

__Closing paragraph:__ Wrap things up nicely, put everything into a nutshell.

__Closing sentence:__ Punshy sentence to make people want to share your article.


### Building a First Draft

__Build out each point__, as little or as much as you want.
 - Just get your ideas down.
 - Don't edit in this stage, this comes later.
 - Once you've built out your outline, __sleep on it__ -> fresh eyes (step away for at least 24 hours)

### 2 Secret Ways to Start any Article:

1. __A Anecdote:__
  - Personal story connecting your article to a narrative involving your personal experience.
  - A story from __your__ life, a story from your life.

2. __A NutGraph:__
  - A nut graph is your entire article in a nutshell paragraph.
  - 1-2 sentences, summarize the entire article.

> Whether you choose nut graph or an anecdote - make sure the __point of your article is clear and evident!__

> You only have about __5-10 seconds to capture someone's attention and convince them to keep reading.__

__Anecdote example:__

"Tyler... Tyler... TYLER."

No, that line you just read wasn't me practicing the spelling of my name. That was a direct quote from my wife as she tried to get my attention recently as i was looking down at my phone. I'm not sure if it was email, social media, or a text message from a friend -- it doesn't really matter -- it's just one example of many where I've attempted to multi-task with my attention.

__Nut Graph example:__

How to Deal with Difficult People

Whether we like it or not, we all have to deal with difficult, negative people or occasions. You may work with one, you may be friends with one, you may even be married to one.
__But the question is, how do you deal with one?__

### The Secret to Revising Your Rough Draft

1. Sleep on your draft
  - At least 2 hours, take a walk and
  - Read it with fresh eyes.
  - Writing is what you do for you.
  - Editing is what you do for your reader.

2. Make sure your article draft matches the `TEMPLATE` and stays on point.
  - Make sure that:
    - Anecdote/Nut Graph is only 2-4 sentences
    - Body Copy has a nice flow/pivot over to the supportive points
    - A listicle can be 10 points, it doesn't matter.
      - Only use 3-4 sentences per point.
    - Closing point should describe to your reader
      - "Why it matters so much that they should share it"
      - "Should be a viral idea"
      - "They should get the word out by sharing it"
    - Closing sentence:
      - "One punsh sentence to make them share it!"

3. 3 questions you should ask when revising:
  - Is it clear?
    - Whats the `#1` thing your trying to communicate in your article?
    - It should be clear what your communicate.
    - If its not clear, people wont care and not share.
  - How does this sound?
    - Read it __aloud__
    - Listen to yourself reading
    - Evaluate how you feel when you read it.
    - Does it feel natural from sentence to sentence?
    - Easy transitions?
    - No big transitions?
  - Does this have personality and slant?
    - Read it and evaluate how it makes you feel emotional
    - Choose a side, can't write for everyone
    - Make sure the passion is in it, make sure humor is in it, make sure emotion is in it.

### The Secret to the First and Final Sentence

#### First

Determines if they're __interested enough to keep reading.__
>If it doesn't relate, their not going to read. SO keep it __quick__!


__Quick and interesting:__
```
`Tyler... Tyler... TYLER!`
```
__Emotional + Clear:__
```
There's a great threat looming over the Church right now.
In my opinion, it's the Church's greatest threat

```
#### Final
Leave a __lasting impression on the reader.__

>Determines the article will be shared and talked about.

> The gift from the writer to the reader before they leave.

__How to write a final sentence?__
  1. Use emotion
  2. Use slant - meaning: take a side
  3. Make a statement and/or call them to action

__Push the message you want to make a difference in the world:__
```
Example: If you think this will make a difference in someones life, be kind and share it.
```
__Share the gravity of your message:__

```
The words we choose determines the atmosphere of our lives and the quality of our relationships
- So choose wisely.
```

This is made trying to tell them that i believe in this message.


#### How to get your Blog shared more

Underneath your last sentence, set up a `call to action` share button.
Ask people to share it, it will make a bigger difference.
