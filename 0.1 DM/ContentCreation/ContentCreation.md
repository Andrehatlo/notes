# 3 Step Writing system: Blogging & Writing 

## You have to have a System to Succeed!

The reason for people not reaching their goal lies in the fact that:

1. They know what their goal is.
2. But the system to reach the goal is not in place.

Develop the system and you can reach any goal you desire.

## 3-Step Writing System

### Step 1: Collection Ideas

Collect Ideas = Collect Inspiration

> If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot".

> The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love."
>> - Austin Kleon, Steal like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told you About Being Creative.

#### Be selective about what you consume 

1. Read what you need
2. Collect content from various sources, but personalize your feeds.
3. Collect with intent to personalize. (Great art inspires art)

- YouTube (miscellaneous - example "Writing Inspiration")


### Step 2: Curate

Meaning:
To pull through, sift through, and select for presentation.

Tips:
1. Curate selectively.
  - Dont select everything.
  - Select what is personal to __you__ and what you are __qualified__ to write about.
2. Think like a museum curator
  - They are specific about what they accept and only choose the top quality.
  - Think quality ideas and best ideas.
3. Only keep the ideas you are passionate about.
  - Write what you are inspired to write about.
  - Be passionate about the topic you are writing.
  - Execute the passionate topics so you connect emotionally.
4. Too many ideas 
  - Store and organize them in a structure so you dont need to keep them in your head.
  - Keen one physical notebook and one digital notebook to store ideas.
  
#### The Secret to Building a Writers Notebook

Rule #1: Make sure its always within reach
  - So you dont loose your ideas.
  
Rule #2: Buy a quality notebook
  - Advantage: Psychological affect:
    - When you pay more it means more which makes you keep up with it better.  

Why a physical notebook:
  - Physical material is more "real" to the brain.
  - It has more meaning, and a place.
  - It is better connected to memory because it engages with its spatial memory networks.
