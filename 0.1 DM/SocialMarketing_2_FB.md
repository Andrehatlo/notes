# Social marketing 2

### How to facebook?

1. Creating a facebook page:

- Make it look professional.
  - Cover image
  - Profile image
- Make it look like the lights are on at your business.
- Have at least 10 relevant posts, including text, pictures and videoes
  - Facebook pages lets you schedule posts for later, or backdate them, so it doesnt look like you postet it all at once.
  - Does not have to be original content

These steps must be done before inviting people to your group.

2. Invite people and friends

- Check the `insight` tab in your facebook page to see when its best to post.
  - By looking at how users interact with your content you can better get a feel of when its best to post.
  - Is it at 8:00 when people leave to work? or at 16:00 when people leave from work?
  - Schedule future posts at these times
  
3. Add the `shop now` or another action button of your liking

- This buttons lie right underneath your coverphoto
- Create an __insentive__ to click the button
  - Exmaple: Grow your mailing list, -> sign up. 
  - Example: Get 30% off if you shop now -> shop now.
  

PRO TIP! Make the coverphoto so that the customers eyes fokus right above your action button for more clicks.

4. Remove default tabs

There are a load of default tabs on the left sidebar of a standard facebook page.

Remove these by going to:
1. Settings
2. Templates and tabs
3. Choose another template if it fits you
4. Move tabs by click and drag. (Move the About to right under Home)
5. Remove tabs you would like to remove
  a. Click the tab settings, turn off
6. Add back tabs at the bottom.

5. Your `About` page

Fill out the entire about page to get prioritized by facebook's crawlers.
Dont leave anything out.

6. Add more posts

Your page needs to look like its not just created in the last hour.
Best tip to keep it easy, is to share other groups content that fit our category.

On another group/profile, find the post you would like to share, then:

1. Click the share button the post.
2. Change the `Position as` to your company page.
3. Add links or comments in the text section.
4. Click post.

REMEMBER! Post at least 1-3 posts a day - THIS CAN BE SHEDUELD

6. Look at your competition to find more ideas for your page.

7. Optimised Facebook settings.

- Make sure all settings are filled out.
- Make sure its published
- Create a `Page role` for your self as `Admin`
  - Create `Page role` for others as under `Admin`
