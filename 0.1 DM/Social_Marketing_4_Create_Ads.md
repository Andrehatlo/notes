# Creating Ads

## Marketing 101

Words in ads are limited, use words that are simple and let cusomers know what to do.

Must have elements in a ad:
1. Logo/brand
2. Value proposition
3. Call to action

Your eyes naturaly flow like this:
1. First from top to bottom
2. Then from left to right

People are psycologically drawen to a button.
- Create a button in your ad image to simulate it for more clicks
