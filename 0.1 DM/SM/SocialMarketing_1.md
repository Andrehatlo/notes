# SocialMedia Marketing 

### Lock up your handles:

Lock up the same social media username/handle on all networks:
(link)[http://namecheckr.com]
(link)[http://namechk.com]

For example if i take Nike:

Nike is taken, so lets try variations:
- nike-fitness
- nike-sport
- real-nike
- official-nike
- the-nike
- nike-us
- nike-eu
- nikeApp
 
Hard to find name variations? Use NAMEMESH.COM

- Will create variations

Handle requirements:

- Length: Shorter is better.
- Consistency: Keep it the same across __ALL__ networks 
    - For search-ability 
- Readability: How easy it is to read and say aloud? 
    - Dont use numbers as letters
- Use your business name (or real name)
- Easy to remember

 
## SMM is key for SEO

- Google algorithm takes SMM into account for SEO for ranking your website
    - Must engage with people 
    - Create original content
    - Post on a regular basis
    
Have at least 2-3 SM accounts that are posted to regularly
    - Easiest: Facebook, twitter and tumbler 
    - Crossposting enabled (When posting one place, gets posted the other places too)

__Why is social media important?__

1. Increased brand recognition
2. Imporved brand loyalty
3. More oppertunities to convert (customer -> buy product) (Easier to find you)
4. Higher conversion rates (customer convertion) (More eyes on product, more sells)
5. High brand authority (when people love your brand, they post on SM)
6. Increased Inbound Traffic
7. Decreased Marketing costs (Facebook ads first, but when they start sharing - free marketing)
8. Better search engine rankings (google algorithm is a BIG part of ranking)
9. Ricker customer experiences (Instant customer interaction - reply on posts as the brand - enhance purchase experience)
10. Imporvoed Customer Insight (You will get review, take them in and do as they say)

        
## What content should i share?

__TEST TEST TEST__
what gets you likes, shares and comments
- celeb imnages/news
- funny memes/viral videos
- IQ test images 
- Clickbait

> Memes, quotes and ecards are money when it comes to viral sharing __FUNNY = SHARABLE__
> TIP: Include a link to your website in every post you make. If someone shares, free marketing
>> Brand your images with your brand and logo and domain name in the top corner of all your memes, quotes, etc conent
    
__WHAT TO POST__

- Keep it short: 80 characters or less 23% higher interactions
- Use photos: 39% higher interaction
- Call to actions still WORK! = Tell fans how they should interact with your post
    - SHARE THIS! - 7x higher rate to share than when not
    - LIKE THIS! - 3x higher rate to like than when not asked
    - COMMENT XYZ - 3.3x higher rate to comment than when not
    
Example: (A funny meme photo) - SHARE THIS! If you are ready for the weekend too
    
__POSTING RULES__

70% of content should add value and build __BRAND__ recognition 
    - Your own meme/quote creation
    - relevant article creation

20% should be sharing of __OTHER__ people ideas, content, YouTube videos, Facebook posts, retweets etc
    - Should be relevant to your brand
    
10% should be posts that are __PROMOTIONAL__
    - Coupons
    - Discount codes
    - New items
    - etc

__TWO GOLDEN RULES OF CONTENT__

1. Commit to posting as much as possible
    - Best way to build and retain a following
        - Consistently post useful interesting information
        - Be mindfull to not overdo it (to much can cause  a follower to unfollow)
       
2. Engange with your followers
    - Build a community with your followers
        - When someone comments, __LIKE IT__ (Like everything, make them feel special and __SEEN__)
        - Ask them questions 
        - __REPLY__ to their comments
    - Purpose is to build a relationship, not just pummel them with promotional talk
