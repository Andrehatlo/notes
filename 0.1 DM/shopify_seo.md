# Keywords are the most important factor

Before starting a ecommerce site, you should have an idea of what type of keywords you are relating to it.
One of these keywords should be in your domain name, for example if your selling shoes, `super-shoes.com`.
This will rank you high on google in that category, thus if you dont have it.

## Keywords

A product need keywords that can be generated through additional services:
1. Keyword planner
2. Ubersuggest
3. LSIgraph

Starting out with the keyword planner, crawl your or a competitors website to fetch potential keywords to use.

Use the additional services to generate more keywords that have less competition.

### LSI

A mathematical method used by Google to detemine the relationship between terms and concepts in content.
The most common words and phrases are identified as the keywords of the crawled webpage.
It looks for synonyms related to the title of your page.

> Example:
> If your page title is "Classic Cars", the search engine would expect to find words relating to that subject in the content of the page.
> It would then look for words like: "collectors", "automobile", "bentley", "austin" and "car auctions".

Paragraph 2 example:

## Description  

#### You want clicks, right? Not views

##### How to be unique and interesting?

__0. Focus on Customer Experience first!__
  - DONT focus all on character count.
  - Stay within the range of 155+ characters.

__3. Containing a focus keyword__

If the search keyword matches a part of the text in the meta description, Google will be more inclined to use that meta description and highlight it in the search results. This will make your site even more inviting.
  
__4. Show specifications__

If your product is tech it can be a good idea to include manufacturer, SKU, etc. Since if your customer is specifically looking for that product, chances are you wont have to convince them. The presence of information like that will trigger the __click__.

__5. Matchinig the Content__

!IMPORTANT

Google will penalize sites that have meta descriptions that trick visitors into clicking.
Always match the content behind the meta description.

__6. Unique__
If you have the same meta description as all other pages, or you own other pages, you'l be better of leaving it blank and let google choose a snippet on your page.

### Examples of GOOD meta descriptions:
