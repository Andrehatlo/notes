# Keywords are the most important factor

Before starting a ecommerce site, you should have an idea of what type of keywords you are relating to it.
One of these keywords should be in your domain name, for example if your selling shoes, `super-shoes.com`.
This will rank you high on google in that category, thus if you dont have it.

## Keywords

A product need keywords that can be generated through additional services:
1. Keyword planner
2. Ubersuggest
3. LSIgraph

Starting out with the keyword planner, crawl your or a competitors website to fetch potential keywords to use.

Use the additional services to generate more keywords that have less competition.

### LSI

A mathematical method used by Google to detemine the relationship between terms and concepts in content.
The most common words and phrases are identified as the keywords of the crawled webpage.
It looks for synonyms related to the title of your page.

> Example:
> If your page title is "Classic Cars", the search engine would expect to find words relating to that subject in the content of the page.
> It would then look for words like: "collectors", "automobile", "bentley", "austin" and "car auctions".

### Product

#### Title

Each product has a title and cescription.
To look professional keep the title at a 5 word max.

So instead of `Copper lamp` or `Ceiling lamp` 
  - Use keywords that gets suggested in the google search field when writing one of the above examples
  - A good title will for example look like this:
    - `Handmade Marokkan Copper Ceiling Lamp`
    
#### Description

The description is the number 1 factor for ranking as number 1 on Google.
The last thing you want to do is keep a description from a warehouse, it will not get you any results.

Write a description of high quality with good keywords, and it will rank the website high on the keywords used.

A quality description:
- The Hook: The title of the description (h1)
  - A description Title that includes words from your title (Example: Lamp to light up your life)
- Paragraph 1:
  - Problem - Statement
- Paragraph 2:
  - Solution to problem
  - Other Benefits
  - End point/statements

Paragraph 1 example:
`I dag er en lampe og taklampe mer en belysning til hjemmet. Det har blitt til det dominante fokus punktet og kan gjøre alt fra å definere stilen og design på kjøkkenet/over kjøkkenbordet, i stuen/over stuebordet, til å skape en energifydlig feng shui atmosphere som skaper mer velvære.`


Paragraph 2 example:
`Vi leverer ekte kobber lamper, inspirert av orientalsk/markokkansk design, håndlaget og gjennomborret for hånd i tidløs design som ikke bare fanger øyet men der hver eneste lampe er unik på sin egen måte. Våre kobber lamper gir den ekte kobber følelsen der metallet lever og vil forandre/endre seg over tid.` 
  
- Ønsker du en mørk, svart/sort lampe har vi kobber lamper som har blitt kjemisk oksidert for å gi en naturlig mørk sort/svart farge. 
- Ønsker du en lampe i sølv, så har vi kobber lamper dekket med et tynt lag ekte sterling sølv der lampen sin vekt er 10% ekte sølv! 
- Ønsker du en kobberlampe så leverer vi nøyaktig det, ikke en lampe malt for å se ut som kobber som lampe gigantene tilbyr for å spare en krone. 

Vi vet at kobber kan koste litt mer, men vi velger å levere edelt metall som har blit glemt over tid. Et metal brukt siden tidenens morgen som gir liv til hjemmet igjen. Feng shui ditt hjem med et naturlig produkt som er skapt for å fange blikket og sette preg på markokkansk design og stil.

https://yoast.com/meta-descriptions/


## Title

How:

- Keep the `Title` clean and readable
- Make sure its unique to your other meta titles.
- People read (Mostly) left to right, then look up and down.
  - Catch the consumer with the first keyword.
- It should explain whats behind the link
- Include your brandname/website name in this type of format `<Meta Title> | <Brandname/Website>` 

  
## Description  

#### You want clicks, right? Not views

##### How to be unique and interesting?

__0. Focus on Customer Experience first!__
  - DONT focus all on character count.
  - Stay within the range of 155+ characters. 

__1. Use an active voice__:
  - Get motivated to design....
  - Why not try a...
  - If you dont have this then...

__2. Include a `Call to action`:__

  - Find out more here!
  - Learn more here!
  - Buy it now!
  
__3. Containing a focus keyword__

If the search keyword matches a part of the text in the meta description, Google will be more inclined to use that meta description and highlight it in the search results. This will make your site even more inviting.
  
__4. Show specifications__

If your product is tech it can be a good idea to include manufacturer, SKU, etc. Since if your customer is specifically looking for that product, chances are you wont have to convince them. The presence of information like that will trigger the __click__.

__5. Matchinig the Content__

!IMPORTANT

Google will penalize sites that have meta descriptions that trick visitors into clicking.
Always match the content behind the meta description.

__6. Unique__
If you have the same meta description as all other pages, or you own other pages, you'l be better of leaving it blank and let google choose a snippet on your page.

### Examples of GOOD meta descriptions:

#### The right length:

>__Puppy Training Schedule: What to Teach Puppies, and When__

> url.com/Dog_Training

> A month by month training schedule for what to teach your new puppy, including the most important lessons puppies should learn.

- Within 155 characters.

#### Active voice

> __Decorating Ideas - Home Decor Ideas and Tips - Good Housekeeping__

> url.com/home/decorating-ideas

> Get motivated to design the home of your dreams with our inspiring looks and practical decorating tips.

- Active, motivating and addressing YOU directly. And you'll know what you'll get!

#### Including a call-to-action

> __robots.txt: the ultimate guide ¬ Yoast__

> url.com/SEO_blog/Crawl_directives

> The robots.txt file is a file you can use to tell search engines where they can and cannot go on your site. Learn how to use it to your advantage!

- `Learn how to use it to your advantage`; that’s the call-to-action!

#### Containing the focus keyword

> __The Oscars 2018 | 90th Academy Awards__

> url.go.com/

> Get the latest news about the __2018 Oscars__, including nominations, winners, predictions and red carpet fashion at 90th __Academy Awards Oscar__.com.

- The focus keyword and variations: note that Google sometimes highlights synonyms like [Academy Awards] as well when searching for [Oscars]. This will make your search result stand out even more.



## SEO 2020

Update in June 2019 set a trend for the rest of the year and 2020:
- Mobile first indexing - make sure you are mobile optimized
- Relevance and topic building up over time + Topic Authority + Writing regular QUALITY content within a certain topic
- Answer box in google
- HTTPS affects ranking

Still __VERY__ important:
- Brand mentions, citations, links, social sharing
- No more outsourcing low quality content
- No more selling everything (one product, one niche)

Content Checklist (article)
- Is information trustworthy?
  - Does it sound written by expert or good enthusuast?
 - Does site have similar articles with keyword variations?
  - keyword variations on competitive sites? reshuffling keywords and re copy and copy pasting the content?
 - Does the page provide substantial value and more insight compared to other pages in search result?
  - Is it an article that stands out in search results?
- Is it interessting, is it well written?
 
#### Backlings matter

Because of the ways sites cut corners since SEO was started, google needed a way to put trust into sites that was ranked high.
This is done through the `Authority` trust system they have implemented.

An authority is a rank that google bases the site on with these metrics:
- Quality content
- Backlinks from other sites with an high autority
- Backlinks from social media platform that shows that the content is high quality (since it is getting shared)

## Three Parts to SEO

1. Keyword research
2. Placing keywords on site
3. Ranking higher and higher


### Google Keyword planner:

#### Checklist/Tips:
- Look for keywords that convert to buys
  - What is a lamp? -> These are not shopping
  - lamp for bedrom -> These may be shopping
  - buy copper lamp -> These are definately shopping
- Long tail keywords are easier to rank on
  - This means keywords that are on 3 or more words, like examples above.
- Use relevant keywords for products you actually sell
- Search demand - Bigger is better but it means more competition
- Is it too competitive to rank for?
- Is it needed or lucrative?
- Jokes/humor content - lots of views but no sales/revenue


#### Three types of searches:
1. Branded, (name or website) - customer who know you looking you up
2. Information: What is a Lamp?
3. Commercial: Buy a lamp

__Save the best keywords in a excel document__

#### Long tail vs Short tail SEO keywords

- Longtail keyword for keyword `Business plan`:
  - How to write a business plan
  - How to write a business plan for a cleaning business
- More specific, longer searches and narrow competition.
- First rank for long-tail keywords, and then do short-tail
- This is the same in all search engines, same process different competition.

- Longtail keyword for keyword `Facebook Marketing`:
  - Facebook marketing for business 
  - Facebook marketing for cleaning business

> Better to use long tail with less searches to get more traffic, than shorter with more traffic and higher competition where you get less traffic.

### Keyword excercise to create unique keywords

Look for akward __HUMAN__ phrasing by talking to PEOPLE.

- Tools give generic answers
- People give us more keyword variations and ideas
- Do customer support, listen to how client and newbies phrase things
- Example: 
  - *SEO Marketing" vs "How to get Google Traffic?"
  - "Arthritis" vs "Knee Pain"

> Be creative, talk to people. Ask what they would search for. __THEN__ use the best keywords in the keyword tools to give more keywords in that category.
> Dont worry about plural or non-plural, search engines are smart enough to get it.

#### Strategies:

1. Local businesses: City name, zip, nearby towns, state, neighborhoods
  - Example: Doctor in downtown San Francisco
2. Problem searches:
  - Example: "Water not running"
3. Solution searches:
  - Example: "Fix plumbing"
4. Look for synonyms - Thesaurus.com
5. Talk to customers (customer support and sales)
  - Customers phrase things differently, listen to their terms
6. Client emails for how they write things
7. Keywords on competitor blogs, websites, and product listings.
8. Search engine auto-suggestions
9. Abbreviations and acronyms (NY, NYC, New York etc)
10. Related searches at the bottom of results
11. Keyword tools
12. Stemming: Play, playing, playful, player
13. When the customer qualifies themselves
  - "Business plan for a productivity mobile app"
  
#### Advanced keyword targeting:

- When writing an article/description etc:
  - Go for the juicy keyword
  - But also use the long tail versions you want to rank for to also get traffic incase you dont rank.
  
##### Page engagement gives a push on yourt Google rank
- Engagement through:
  - Social media mentions
  - Youtube video backlinks
  - etc
 
#### Keywords Density tool

tools.seobook.com/general/keyword-density

Check the density of your keywords on a website.
Compare yourself to your competitor website by increasing density in your article.

Returns 3 columns, with keywords and keyword phrases:
- First column: Single keyword density -> 5% is perfect, 7% is ok, dont go over 10% 
- Second column: 2 Word Phrase density -> Stay under 4-5%
- Third column: 3 Word Phrase density  -> Stay under 4-5%

Dont get penilized for keyword stuffing by having a high keyword density.
- This happens when your text is not flowing naturally, so keep in mind that writing a good article needs to be natural with the keyword.

# Is your site set up for SEO?

Crawlable and indexable?

## On Page SEO (!important)

When you have the keyword you want to rank for, we call it the `Focus Keyword`.
This keyword will have to be strategically placed through the page to rank high on Google.

It has to be included in:
- Article Heading
- Page title
- Page URL
- Content -> Many times
- Meta Description

### Meta SEO

Meta description and meta title is the information that IS NOT displayed on your webpage. Its something that is displayed for the search engines for your benefit. So instead of your page being displayed with lengthy sentances and titles that make less sence for the perticular search term, you can customize these titles and decriptions to get more traffic to your site.

- Your focus keyword should be mentioned in:
- Meta title (70 characters)
- Meta description (160 characters)
- Url redirect (google prefers short urls)

### Gain rank by a `Cornerstone SEO page` 

When theres high competition any old webpage can compete, so what do you do?

__Create a cornerstone page:__
- Page with THE BEST information on the topic.
  - Covers the topic in the most authoritive way.
  - Alot of other different content on topic. 
  - Covers it from alot of different angles.
  
Makes users stay longer, which gives Google a postive signal to rank you higher.

#### Structuring a cornerstone page:

- `<h1>` tag: 1
- `<h2>` tag: 5-10
- Content must be:
  - Very Insightfull
  - Good grammar/spelling
  - Good content
  
#### Interlinking your pages

Getting backlinks is not easy, but you can get a boost from google just by interlinking your site.
Which means linking to other articles in your articles, where you strategically set the anchor text to be some keyword you want to rank for (should have something to do with the content behind it).

#### Advanced Interlinking:

Include a table of content for your articles.
Simple do something like this:

```html
<li><a href="www.orientdesign.no/blog/articles/real-copper/#content_1">What is Copper?</a></li>
<li><a href="www.orientdesign.no/blog/articles/real-copper/#content_2">Why does Copper oxidize?</a></li>
<li><a href="www.orientdesign.no/blog/articles/real-copper/#content_3">3 Proven health benefits you get from Copper</a></li>

<a name="content_1"></a></p>

<h2> What is Copper? </h2>
//... content 1

<a name="content_2"></a></p>

<h2> Why does copper oxidize</h2>
//... content 2

<a name="content_3"></a></p>

<h2> 3 Proven health benefits you get from Copper? </h2>
//... content 3
```
