### Step 1

Find seed keywords you want to rank in Google search ORGANICALLY

> You want to eventually rank for __many__ keywords! 
> But start by focusing on a keywords you will __POSITIVELY__ rank #1 for in Google Search!


__Long tail keywords:__ 

Keywords that have 5000 searches a day are wonderful, but in reality, these search terms only make up 30% of daily searches. You have more than 70% more to try to catch customers on.

These search keywords are called `long tail keywords`:

Ex of long tail keywords:

Good becaouse:

## How to generate keywords?

You know your business best.
Start with the
- The names of your products: egyptian lamp, egyptian lamp etc 
- The names of your services: massage drammen, etc

> Input them into google search, what do you get?
> What keywords do you see in the title's and metadescription's?
> This is where you should start! 
> This top listing organic listings (and even googleAdWords) have obviously done something right, to rank on the top page of google search.

This is the best way to generate keywords:

__Do one of these:__
- Search niche forums
- Browse a library 
- Test Google AutoComplete searches with different keywords 
- Search your product/service on wikipedia
- Look at competitors websites and ads online, what keywords make them rank so high?
- Read newpapers, what headlines are catching peoples attention?
- Search amazon/ebay and look at their autocommplete for keywords
- Search ClickBank.com and see what keywords they use there
- Check out GoogleTrends to see what keywords are popular. (Search volume for specific keyword)
- Watch TV commercials and infomercials to see how they catch customers attention.

Notice the words on the products around you, the so called branding, like when you see Nike, its 'Just do it'.

Google/Amazon AutoComplete:
- Put your first keyword in, ex: `Lampe` 
- See what you get back from google autocomplete
- If example: `lampe egypt` was in the list, this would be a good sign. (meaning alot of people are searching this).
- These keywords you find we can use in articles/blog posts at our website to make customers come to us `organically`!

  - `Majestic Trust Flow` and `Citation Flow`
  - `Links` 
  - `Site age`
  - and other factors of the top 10 pages found in Google result for the keyword you searched.
